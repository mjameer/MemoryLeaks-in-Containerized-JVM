If you find yourself grappling with a memory leak issue in your containerized Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it's essential to take strategic steps to pinpoint and address the problem. Here's a systematic approach to help you identify and resolve memory leaks:


#### 1. Utilize JDK Over JRE:
Ensure you are using the images that have Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than running apps in images that have Java Runtime Environment (JRE). JDK provides essential development tools such as compilers and debuggers, which are crucial for capturing heap dumps.

#### 2. Periodically Capture Heap Dumps:

Capture heap dumps at regular intervals, preventing the application from exceeding memory limits and triggering restarts. This proactive approach allows you to analyze memory usage patterns over time.

#### 3. Analyze Heap Dumps:

Examine the instance counts and monitor elements with continuous increases between heap dumps.

#### 4. Investigate Problematic Code:

Delve into the code associated with the increasing instances of specific classes. This investigation helps pinpoint where and how these classes are being utilized, aiding in the identification of potential memory leak sources.

#### 5. Visulaize Data

Visualize the data to identify patterns or anomalies. For instance, comparing heap dumps may reveal a specific class, like KafkaMetric, experiencing a significant increase in instances, providing a valuable clue to the underlying issue.

#### 6. Check Library Versions:

Verify whether the library version containing the problematic class has a history of reported memory leak issues. Explore open-source repositories and forums to check for documented memory leak problems associated with the specific library version in use.

#### 7. Document and Resolve:

Document your findings, including any problematic code snippets, screenshots, or identified library versions. Implement fixes or optimizations to address the root causes of the memory leaks.

#### Conclusion:

By following these steps, you can systematically identify, isolate, and resolve memory leak issues in containerized JVM applications. Periodic heap dump analysis, code investigation, and library version checking contribute to a comprehensive strategy for ensuring the stability and efficiency of your Java applications.
